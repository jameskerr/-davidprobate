Where to even begin. When my grandmother passed away I was completely taken over with grief and had to immediately jump into action to step up and take care of everything.  

17 days prior I had just had major surgery and you know what? That doesn't matter! Life doesn't stop! I had to set everything aside and just take care of my now deceased grandmother and her esteate. Big lessons learned! Probate is a hard long process and a LOT of people who DON'T care coupled with a few sprinkled in who do care, start calling/emailing/writing you, HOUNDING YOU. And David was one of the few who was sprinkled in that cared! 

David was kind, gentle, considerate, willing to listen, willing to help, went above and beyond my expectations of what I thought a realtor would do. He understood and was compassionate to the fact that it was my grandmother who I loved and lost. He was sensitive to how I wanted to handle her home and her belongings and how they were sentimental to me and how I knew she valued them. He didnt treat me just like a number, he treated me like a vauled person. 

And when it came to crunch time and I needed real dirty gritty help! David put gloves on, dug through a VERY NASTY shed, threw it in a truck and helped me at the dump! David worked very hard for me and my grandmother and I highly recomend him! 

I just want to say one last time in a very public way, THANK YOU DAVID!
