title: 'Single Family Home Sold in Victorville'
---

There isnâ€™t a high enough rating on Zillow that expresses the value David brought to the table. I choose David because he was kind, professional and he most of all expressed a very helpful and caring attitude. David helped with the sale of my uncles estate in Victorville CA. 

He was always very responsive with my many questions and just made the entire process soo easy for me during a difficult time. He met me at the property a few times which was no small feat for to the distance for both of us. Not only did he commit to helping me sell the property, he also helped in other practical ways that I would have had to go out of my way to coordinate; like strapping the water heater to code, and installing a carbon monoxide detector to satisfy inspections. 

The signage, photos and advertising he provided was very professional and worked! I could not have found a better agent to represent our family and in a heartbeat would choose him again! Thank you for all your help, dedication and support David!
