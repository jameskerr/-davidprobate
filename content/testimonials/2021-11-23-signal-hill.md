I wish I could give David TEN stars all around. I was looking for a realtor by looking at reviews because I had to sell my sister's property in probate.  Her property is in California and I live in Pennsylvania. It seemed hard to believe that someone as hard-working, dependable, professional and kind as David actually exists. The reviews said he helped pack and move a tenant.  It said he helped do repairs on property.  I wondered if he was too good to be true.  DAVID IS AS GOOD AS THE REVIEWS AND EVEN BETTER!!! Anyone who is lucky enough to find David has found a ONE IN A MILLION realtor who will go above and beyond to help you! Me and my family could NOT have accomplished the sale of my sister's condo without David. He was helping everyday for weeks. He did in fact help move the tenant. He DID do many repairs on site. He answered calls ALWAYS and promptly. I feel my words are inadequate to thank David enough for all he did! We put the property to show on a Sunday and it was in escrow by Wednesday (three days later)  David followed up and made sure escrow closed smoothly.  If you are looking for the best realtor out there, I highly recommend that you call David. You will be glad you did!  I certainly was!!   

Gratefully,
Clenice Vincent
