David helped me sell my motherâ€™s house after she passed away. The house was located in a different state than where I lived and David went above and beyond with helping the sale.. This included helping with the final packing and moving of the furniture/items from the house; and making sure that all the things the buyer wanted done as a condition of the sale were done in the most cost effective manner including doing some of them himself. I am in awe with the service he provided and would highly recommend him as your realtor.
