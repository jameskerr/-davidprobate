title: 'Single Family Home Sold in Palm Desert'
---

David was wonderful to work with in the recent sale of my fathers estate. I initially chose to work with him because he was so polite and persistent during the initial probate process. During the transaction David was very responsive, within the hour, and always happy to help. I was selling my Dad's home in Palm Desert, and live a few hours away, therefore I wasn't able to be there all the time. 

David was at the house on weekends and helped me clean out some of the big furniture, I couldn't have done it without him. He also assisted me with the sale of my Dad's car and getting the appropriate paperwork from the DMV.  Most importantly, he was patient every step of the way and always made me feel as if we were working towards the same common goal. As with many families, it was a bumpy road at times. 

David was understanding and did everything possible to make it as smooth of a chapter for me and my family. He went above and beyond, truly. I highly recommend working with David, he was fantastic.  I am confident you will feel the same.
