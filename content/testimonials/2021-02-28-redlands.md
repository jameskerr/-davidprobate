David Kerr is a committed agent. He did what he said he was going to do when we signed him up. Several corrections needed to be made with the property. David completed some of the work himself (pipes under the sink, removal of trash from garage, leveling dirt around house), which we so appreciated since we lived out of state. He said at the beginning that he would do all things necessary to get the property ready for sale and he did. He was amazing! He also returned calls and emails promptly and was efficient in every way. He was always friendly and helpful. My wife and I highly recommend him.
