title: 'Single Family Home Bought in Laguna Niguel'

We needed a realtor who knew south Orange Co., as we are from San Diego.  David was that realtor.  He was patient and knowledgeable, showing us house after house.  He was always available by phone or e-mail to answer our questions.  When we found the house we wanted to buy, he helped us with the endless forms and kept the process running smoothly through close of escrow.  My husband and I think highly of David and do not hesitate to recommend him.
