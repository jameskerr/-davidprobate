David Kerr truly saved the day for me.  I had been given 3 weeks to move out of the condo I had lived in for 21 years after my sister, who was the owner, passed away with no will.  The Estate Administrator notified me that an agent, David Kerr, had been given the property listing.  

I received a call from David, and then he showed up with a trunk, full of boxes, tape and bubble wrap for me.  He was very professional, considerate , and kept in touch and even helped me pack boxes.

I learned quickly to trust David, and he was always available and always returned my calls.  David even helped me move to my new residence.  David is an honest, outstanding, hard working and brilliant licensed realitor.

Anyone selling a property would be really lucky to have David as their realitor. 

It is not so easy to find a person like David to work with.  He made a great sale and handled all of the paperwork and forms smoothly. He is the very best there is!!
